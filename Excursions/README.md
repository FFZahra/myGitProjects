# Excursion
An off-platform Codecademy project.  

This project is to build a web page to advertise an upcoming product; a mobile app which helps users record and share their travel experiences.

The main files are:
* the index file **index.html**.
* the style sheet **style.css**, and
* an image, an icon, and a video clip.
